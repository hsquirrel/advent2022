These are solutions, written in C# on .NET 7, to the 
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge.

The idea is to write the very first solution that comes to mind (SolutionA1 for the first problem 
of the day and SolutionB1 for the second) and then attempt a few different approaches looking for
either more elegant or more efficient solutions. I utilize the BenchmarkDotNet toolset to measure
the efficiency of each solution.

I have no interest competing on any leaderboards. This is just for fun, and as such, I will only be
working on solutions when I have some spare time that I feel like dedicating to it. I definitely will
not be keeping pace with the calendar. However, the fun is in the solving, so I will not be looking
at anyone else's solutions until I have finished the day's challenge myself.
